Project Overview

Code Safari is an interactive, jungle-themed website designed to make learning HTML basics fun and engaging for children.Instead of presenting coding as plain text, the project transforms 
it into an adventure where learners explore, play, and gradually build their knowledge in a creative safari setting.This project was created as a team collaboration, with the goal of making
web development approachable for absolute beginners.Children are guided step by step, starting with a welcoming homepage, moving into a live coding playground, and finishing their journey 
with a quiz and certificate of achievement. What makes Code Safari stand out is its immersive theme. The use of animals, animations, and nature-inspired visuals creates an environment that 
feels exciting and playful.The learning experience is intentionally designed to feel less like a traditional class and more like a game, allowing learners to stay motivated while grasping 
the fundamentals of HTML.  

Features 
The website is structured into several pages that each serve a unique role in the learning journey:  
- The Home Page provides a welcoming introduction with animations and jungle-inspired visuals that set the tone for the project.  
- The Code Page gives children an opportunity to experiment with live HTML coding, where they can type code and instantly see the results.  
- The About Us Page introduces the creators and briefly explains the motivation behind the project.  
- The Map Page offers an element of exploration, making the website feel adventurous and varied rather than linear.  
- The Quiz Page concludes the experience with an interactive quiz where learners test their knowledge and, upon success, receive a personalized certificate of achievement.  


Learning Goals  
The primary goal of Code Safari is to teach the fundamentals of HTML, focusing on tags, attributes, and document structure.  
Rather than relying on static lessons, the project encourages children to learn by experimenting with live code and seeing immediate results.  
Another important aim is to show that technology can be both educational and creative. By integrating playful visuals and rewarding elements, the project makes web development more 
approachable and less intimidating. The design demonstrates that learning does not need to be rigid or overly technical; it can instead be engaging, interactive, and fun.  

Tech Stack  
The project is built using three core web technologies:  

- HTML5 is the foundation of the website and the main subject being taught. All structure and learning content is created using HTML.  
- CSS3 is used for styling, responsive layouts, and animations that make the safari theme visually immersive.  
- JavaScript provides interactivity, powers the quiz logic, and generates the personalized certificate that learners receive at the end of their journey.  

This project highlights how technology can be introduced to beginners in a manner that is accessible, engaging, and memorable. It demonstrates that with the right approach, learning to 
code can be transformed into an experience that is both fun and deeply educational.
